### User Story

```
As a user, 
I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once,
So that I have quick access to their information.

```

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
